FAQ:

Q - Why is the README not a Markdown file?
A - Originally so that this project was ONE HUNDRED PERCENT Rust, but now that
    there is a Nix flake this is no longer true :(

Q - What's the point of this project?
A - Clonck aims to be fast, accurate, and Japanese. It accomplishes all three of
    these goals in spades. To be more specific, this program was intended to be
    used in Linux status bars like Waybar. But obviously, it can be used however
    you'd like.

Q - Why "Clonck"?
A - Why not?
