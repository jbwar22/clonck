FAQ:

Q - Why is the README not a Markdown file?
A - So that this project is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT Rust.

Q - What's the point of this project?
A - Clonck aims to be fast, accurate, and Japanese. It accomplishes all three of
    these goals in spades. To be more specific, this program was intended to be
    used in Linux status bars like Waybar. But obviously, it can be used however
    you'd like.

Q - Why "Clonck"?
A - Why not?
